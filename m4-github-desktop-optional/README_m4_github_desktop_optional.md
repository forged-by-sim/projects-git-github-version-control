## 💬 Reflection  
Even as an optional module, this was a valuable **behind-the-scenes refresher** on how Git works beyond cloud-based labs. It emphasized the importance of local Git tooling — something I already practice across multiple development environments.

Key takeaways:
- SSH setup is critical for private/public repo workflows  
- Local Git fluency enhances real-world DevOps readiness  
- GitHub Desktop offers a smooth middle ground between UI and CLI

This module added confidence to my understanding of secure, flexible Git workflows — especially when pushing from different devices or local IDEs.
