# Getting Started With Git and GitHub by IBM 

📘 Git & GitHub — Course Documentation (IBM)

A complete, structured documentation archive of my work for the Coursera/IBM course Getting Started with Git and GitHub, including fundamentals, command-line workflows, final project submissions, and external repositories created as part of the course’s peer-graded and practice assignments.

This repo serves as my personal learning record and a clean reference for future development work involving version control, open-source documentation, branching strategies, and collaborative workflows.

📚 Course Overview

This course introduced the foundations of version control using Git and remote repository workflows using GitHub. Through hands-on practice, UI-based tasks, peer-graded assignments, and command-line workflows, I learned how modern development teams collaborate, maintain clean commit histories, and structure open-source-ready repositories.

The skills gained here form a backbone for all future programming work — including XR development, simulation engineering, C/C++, Python, and more.

📘 Module Summaries
🟦 Module 1 — Git & GitHub Fundamentals

Introduced the core ideas behind version control and repository structures:

What Git is and why developers use it

Basic GitHub UI concepts

Repositories, commits, branches, PRs

Clean commit messaging

Early project documentation structures

📁 Folder: module1-git-and-github-fundamentals/
✔ Graded quizzes included (100% score)

🟩 Module 2 — Git Commands & Managing GitHub Projects

Shifted from UI workflows into command-line Git fundamentals:

git clone, git add, git commit, git push

Working with branches and merging

Forking vs cloning

Managing projects through CLI

Understanding upstream vs origin remotes

📁 Folder: module2-git-commands-and-managing-github-projects/
✔ Practice + graded quizzes (100%)

🟧 Module 3 — Final Project & Assessment

This module simulated real-world open-source workflows using two full projects:

🔹 Practice Project (Part 1 – GitHub UI)

Created and configured a new repo with:

README

License

Code of Conduct

Contribution Guidelines

A branch and PR workflow

A simple shipping-logistics assignment

📁 Folder: module3-final-project-and-assessment/1-practice-project-part1-github-ui/

Practice Project Part 2 (CLI) was not completed — the course auto-marked it complete.

🔹 Final Project (Part 1 – GitHub UI)

Set up a full GitHub project from scratch, including all supporting docs and initial script files.

📁 Folder: 3-final-project-part1-github-ui/
✔ Completed and submitted for peer review

🔹 Final Project (Part 2 – Git CLI)

Completed entirely via command-line in the Skills Network environment:

Fork → Clone → Branch

File edits and documentation fixes

Commit, push, PR

Revert erroneous changes

Merge workflow

Peer review submission

📁 Folder: 4-final-project-part2-git-cli/
✔ Peer-graded assignment — 100%

🟪 Module 4 — Optional: Working with GitHub from Windows Desktop

Installed Git Bash, created SSH keys, and explored desktop workflows.

✨ Reflection: What This Course Built in Me

This course wasn’t just about learning Git commands — it was about learning discipline, structure, and the mindset of a developer who contributes clearly and responsibly to shared codebases.

I learned how to:

Think in terms of clean version history

Treat documentation as part of the product

Organize repos like someone else will use them

Follow professional branching strategies

Merge confidently without fear

Fix mistakes instead of hiding them

Collaborate with clarity and respect

This Git/GitHub foundation now strengthens every project I build — from XR WebAR scenes to C++ algorithms, MATLAB scripts, or Python visualizations.
It also prepares me for teamwork in simulation labs, XR studios, or engineering organizations where version control is non-negotiable.

This course taught me the language of collaboration — which is essential for my long-term path in simulation engineering.
