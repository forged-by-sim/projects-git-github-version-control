## 🧭 About This Repository  
This repo documents my journey building **professional Git fluency** through a full stack of version control workflows — using GitHub's Web UI, Git CLI, and GitHub Desktop.

Each module includes real-world simulations: initializing repos, branching and merging, writing clear commit histories, handling pull requests, reverting mistakes, and using open-source conventions like `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`.

The goal:  
To showcase how I use Git not just to manage code, but to **collaborate, communicate, and ship cleanly.**

## 🔍 Highlight Projects

| Project | Folder | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| GitHub UI Practice | `p1-practice-github-ui` | Initialized repo, added docs, and merged branches — all in the browser |
| GitHub UI Final | `p3-final-github-ui` | Created a full open-source-style repo with LICENSE, README, and example code |
| Git CLI Final | `p4-final-git-cli` | Forked, merged, reverted, and listed branches entirely via terminal |
| Archived Practice | `p2-skipped-git-cli-practice` | Skipped to focus on deeper CLI tasks — documented for transparency |

## 💬 Reflection  
This repo started as a skills course — but became a foundation for **how I approach teamwork in code**.

By completing both UI and CLI workflows, I now treat Git as more than just a tool. It’s a discipline:
- Clear commit messages tell the story of a project
- Thoughtful branches reduce team collisions
- Well-structured repos help new contributors onboard faster

Whether managing solo XR builds or collaborating in simulation projects, this workflow mindset now guides every technical repo I create.
