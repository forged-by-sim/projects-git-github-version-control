🎯 Module Objective

Module 1 introduced the foundational concepts behind version control, Git repositories, and the basics of working with GitHub. The lessons focused on understanding how developers track changes, collaborate on shared codebases, and use GitHub as a platform for remote storage and team workflows.

Through a mix of short videos, hands-on readings, and two practice quizzes, I strengthened my practical understanding of how Git organizes project history and why branching, staging, and committing are core to software development.

📝 Reflection

This module served as a quick but solid refresher on Git concepts I already use in my personal projects. While it was introductory, it helped reinforce the importance of:

Clean, descriptive commit messages

Logical branch organization

Tracking changes clearly for collaborative environments

Keeping repositories structured and readable

This foundation prepared me for more hands-on Git operations in later modules and aligned with my growing discipline around maintaining professional GitHub repos for my technical portfolio.
