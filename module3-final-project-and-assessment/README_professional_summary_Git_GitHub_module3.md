📘 Module 3: Final Project and Assessment

Course: Getting Started with Git and GitHub (IBM)
Platform: Coursera
Completed: ✅
Directory: module3-final-project-and-assessment

🎯 Module Objective

This final module brought together all Git and GitHub skills learned across the course. Through a combination of a UI-based practice project and a two-part final project (GitHub UI + Git CLI), I applied version control fundamentals in a realistic workflow:

Creating repositories

Adding and editing project documentation

Applying open-source best practices

Managing branches and pull requests

Fixing repository issues using Git CLI

Forking, cloning, committing, merging, pushing, and reverting changes

Submitting a project for peer review

This module simulates how real developers maintain open-source repositories and collaborate across distributed teams.

📁 Directory Structure

You have four subfolders, each with its own .md instructions and screenshot evidence:

1-practice-project-part1-github-ui/

2-practice-project-part2-git-cli/

3-final-project-part1-github-ui/

4-final-project-part2-git-cli/

🧪 Practice Project (Part 1 – GitHub UI)
📍 Directory

1-practice-project-part1-github-ui/

📄 Files Included

Practice Project 1 – GitHub UI.pdf

docs_practice_project1.md

Step-by-step task screenshots (task_1_url repo.png, task_2_license.png, etc.)

Markdown files for README, Code of Conduct, Contributing Guidelines, and Simple Interest instructions

📝 Summary

Using the GitHub UI, I completed the following tasks:

Created a new repository (LogisticsShippingRates)

Selected an open-source license (Apache 2.0)

Updated the README with project purpose

Added Code of Conduct

Added Contributing Guidelines

Created a new branch for the shipping-logistics script

Added the Shipping Calculation Code

Opened a Pull Request and merged the branch into main

This project demonstrated GitHub UI fundamentals: repository setup, documentation, file changes, branch creation, and pull requests.

⭐ Note

Practice Project Part 2 (Git CLI) was not completed. Coursera marked it complete automatically, but it was not part of my workflow. Only Part 1 (UI) is represented in this repo for accuracy and integrity.

🧪 Final Project Part 1 – GitHub UI
📍 Directory

3-final-project-part1-github-ui/

📝 Scenario

You join a micro-finance startup transitioning from SVN to Git. The team provides a simple interest calculator script and asks you to:

Host it in a new GitHub repository

Add documentation and open-source support files

Follow GitHub best practices

Share the repository publicly

✔ Tasks Completed

Using GitHub’s Web UI:

Created a new repository (github-final-project)

Added a README.md file

Added an Apache License 2.0 file

Created a Code of Conduct

Created Contributing Guidelines

Added simple-interest.md documentation

Committed all new files

Uploaded URLs for peer review submission

📁 Files Included

🧪 Final Project Part 2 – Git CLI
📍 Directory

4-final-project-part2-git-cli/

📝 Scenario

After your initial repository setup, the company creates a new centralized project for all developers. A documentation issue is discovered, and you are assigned to:

Fork the upstream repository

Clone it locally

Fix the issue using Git CLI

Commit, push, and open a PR

Revert a mistaken change

Merge your branch back to main

This part simulates real-world collaborative maintenance of shared repositories.

✔ Tasks Completed With Git CLI

Forked the upstream repo for peer review

Cloned the repo locally in the Skills Network environment

Created a new branch

Made required edits and committed them

Merged the branch into main

Opened a Pull Request

Performed a git revert to undo a mistaken change

📁 Files Included

1fork repository for peer review.md

3revert.md

4branches names.md

📝 Reflection

This module tied together everything I learned about Git and GitHub. It was my first time completing a full open-source-style workflow: initializing repos, structuring documentation, branching logically, fixing errors, and collaborating through pull requests.

More importantly, it built the discipline I now carry into all my GitHub projects:

Clean commit history

Clear branching strategy

Proper licensing

Professional documentation

Organized repo structure

Confidence with both UI and CLI workflows

Completing this module helped solidify my foundations as a simulation technologist building a strong technical portfolio — and prepared me for collaborating in real development environments.
