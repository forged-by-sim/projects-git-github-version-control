🎯 Module Objective

Module 2 expanded beyond GitHub’s web interface and into Git command-line workflows. The lectures and demos focused on how GitHub repositories connect to local development environments, how branches are created and merged through Git commands, and how cloning/forking support real-world collaborative workflows.

By the end of this module, I had a stronger understanding of Git’s operational flow: staging → committing → branching → merging → pushing. I also learned how developers manage GitHub projects efficiently using command-line tools instead of relying solely on the web UI.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Learned
Tools Used

Git (Command Line Interface)

GitHub (Web UI + remote repository management)

Skills Practiced

Using Git commands for:

git clone

git fork (conceptual)

git status

git branch / git switch / git checkout

git add / git commit / git push

git merge

Understanding developer workflows:

Local → Remote syncing

Working with branches in CLI

Managing GitHub project settings

Seeing how teams use forks for open-source collaboration

This module bridged the gap between conceptual Git knowledge and real-world source control workflows.

📝 Reflection

This module clarified how developers use Git in real projects — not just through the GUI, but through command-line workflows that provide finer control and speed. Understanding how to branch, commit, and merge locally gave me a clearer picture of how software teams work in parallel without overwriting each other’s contributions.

It also reinforced best practices I’m already applying across my GitHub portfolio:

Keeping branches organized

Writing clear commit messages

Maintaining clean, intentional repo structures

Using Git as a tool for storytelling through code history

Now that both Module 1 and Module 2 are complete, I can confidently integrate Git workflows into my simulation and XR development projects.
