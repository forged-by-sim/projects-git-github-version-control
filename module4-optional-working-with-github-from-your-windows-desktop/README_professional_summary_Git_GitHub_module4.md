📝 Reflection

Even though this module was optional, it reinforced the importance of understanding how Git works outside browser-based interfaces and cloud labs. The SSH setup process is especially relevant for real-world environments, as it enables secure, password-less authentication when pushing to private or public repositories.

Since I already practice Git across multiple machines, this module served as a lightweight refresher on best practices for configuring developer tooling on Windows.
