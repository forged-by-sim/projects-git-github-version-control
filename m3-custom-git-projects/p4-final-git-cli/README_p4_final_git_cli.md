# 🧪 Final Project – Git CLI Peer Review Simulation  
**Folder**: `p4-final-git-cli`  
**Focus**: Forking, branching, reverting, and peer review using Git CLI  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This final CLI-based project simulated a **peer review scenario** using Git command line workflows. The tasks covered forking a public repo, working across multiple branches, merging feature code, and reverting accidental commits — all while demonstrating comfort with project navigation and collaboration at the CLI level.

## 🛠️ Core CLI Tasks Performed  

| Task | Action |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Task 1 | Forked a repository for peer review and cloned it locally |
| ✅ Task 2 | Merged two development branches into `main` |
| ✅ Task 3 | Reverted a commit using `git revert` |
| ✅ Task 4 | Listed all branch names and identified the active branch |

All tasks were completed using Git CLI and confirmed with screenshots.

## 🧠 CLI Concepts Practiced  

- Remote repo forking and local cloning  
- Branch-based development  
- Merging changes and resolving history  
- Reverting commits to undo mistakes  
- Navigating branches via `git branch` and `git checkout`

## 💬 Reflection  
This project brought together everything I had practiced in earlier modules — but purely through **Git CLI**. It highlighted the power and precision of the command line when managing code history, correcting mistakes, and preparing work for collaboration.

What stood out most:

- I no longer fear merge conflicts — I understand their anatomy  
- I can fork, clone, push, and revert with clarity  
- The command line now feels like a fluent language, not just a list of commands  

With this final project complete, I’ve gained full-stack Git fluency — from browser-based GitHub workflows to command-line project orchestration — a skillset I now carry into my simulation, XR, and collaborative development work.
