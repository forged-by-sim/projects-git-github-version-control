# 🌐 Practice Project – GitHub UI Workflows  
**Folder**: `p1-practice-github-ui`  
**Focus**: Managing repositories, branches, and collaboration tasks using GitHub's web interface

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This project simulated an onboarding task for a remote developer contributing to a logistics software repository. All version control actions were completed through the GitHub **browser UI**, without using Git CLI. The tasks covered repo initialization, documentation setup, branching, pull requests, and team collaboration norms.

## 💬 Reflection  
This hands-on project helped me simulate a GitHub-first contributor workflow. I gained clarity on:

- Repository setup and file creation via UI  
- Applying open-source collaboration practices (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING)  
- Branch-based feature development and PR reviews  
- Navigating GitHub’s file structure, history, and merge logic

Completing this project strengthened my readiness to onboard into existing GitHub-hosted projects, even in environments where command-line access is restricted or collaborators prefer UI-based workflows.
