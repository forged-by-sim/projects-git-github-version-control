# 🧱 M3 – Custom Git Projects  
**Folder**: `m3-custom-git-projects`  
**Focus**: Real-world simulations of Git workflows using GitHub UI and Git CLI  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module challenged me to apply Git concepts to full project simulations. Instead of isolated commands, I built full repositories, added documentation, contributed to codebases, merged feature branches, and reverted mistakes — mimicking real collaboration cycles.

Each project focuses on a different workflow style (UI vs CLI) and required clear, clean commits and structured file management.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Folder | Project | Tools | Summary |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| `p1-practice-github-ui` | Practice Project (UI) | GitHub Web UI | Initialized repo, added docs, created branches, merged code using browser |
| `p2-skipped-git-cli-practice` | Skipped | — | Archived placeholder; moved on to final CLI project |
| `p3-final-github-ui` | Final Project (UI) | GitHub Web UI | Built open-source-style repo with `README`, `LICENSE`, and sample code |
| `p4-final-git-cli` | Final Project (CLI) | Git CLI | Forked, merged, and reverted code entirely through terminal-based Git |

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced Across Projects

- Repository scaffolding using browser interface and CLI  
- Creating and merging development branches  
- Open-source repo hygiene (`README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`)  
- Using Git revert to safely undo changes  
- Writing clean commit histories that tell a story  
- Simulating pull request and peer review cycles

## 💬 Reflection  
This module transitioned me from Git learner to Git practitioner.

I now feel confident navigating both solo and collaborative repositories — whether I’m contributing through a browser, coding in terminal, or onboarding new developers into structured, beginner-friendly repos.

These hands-on builds now shape how I structure all my technical projects — from simulation prototyping to open-source XR development.
