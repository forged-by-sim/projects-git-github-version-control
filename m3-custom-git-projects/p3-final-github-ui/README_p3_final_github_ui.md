# 📦 Final Project – GitHub UI Repository Build  
**Folder**: `p3-final-github-ui`  
**Focus**: Building a full-featured GitHub repository using the browser-based UI

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This final GitHub UI project simulated an end-to-end contributor flow for standing up a professional repository from scratch using only GitHub's web interface. I created key community and documentation files, simulated open-source norms, and uploaded functional code — all directly through the browser.

## 🛠️ Key Files Created  

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `1URLrepo.md` | Contains repo URL for project identification |
| `2License.md` | MIT license declaration for open-source usage |
| `3ReadMe.md` | Project overview and documentation entrypoint |
| `4CodeOfConduct.md` | Contributor behavior guidelines |
| `5Contributing.md` | Setup for team contribution processes |
| `6simple-interest.md` | Sample Python logic for interest calculation |

These were all created through GitHub’s UI and organized with best practices for beginner-friendly, collaborative repositories.

Each image captures a live snapshot of the GitHub interface as I built the repo step-by-step.

## 💬 Reflection  
This final UI-only project demonstrated that a complete, collaborative-ready GitHub repository can be created without ever touching the command line. It highlighted:

- The importance of community files (`README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`)  
- Open-source contributor etiquette  
- Navigating GitHub’s web-based file editor  
- Structuring projects for clarity, collaboration, and transparency  

This exercise reinforced how important good documentation and repo hygiene are — especially when onboarding new contributors or publishing public-facing work.
