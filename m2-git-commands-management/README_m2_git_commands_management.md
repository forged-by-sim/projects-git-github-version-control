# 🧩 M2 – Git Commands & Repo Management  
**Folder**: `m2-git-commands-management`  
**Focus**: Core Git command-line workflows for local-to-remote version control and repository collaboration  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module deepened my understanding of **Git’s operational flow** beyond the GUI. I practiced branching, committing, merging, and pushing changes through the terminal, reinforcing real-world GitHub collaboration workflows. I also explored how teams manage repositories through structured CLI use and forking patterns to enable open-source contribution models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Practiced  

**Tools Used**  
- Git (Command Line Interface)  
- GitHub (Web interface + remote repo collaboration)

**Core Skills**  
- Using Git for local → remote syncing  
- Initializing and managing projects with Git CLI  
- Branching and switching between features (`git branch`, `git switch`)  
- Staging and committing changes (`git add`, `git commit`)  
- Pushing changes to remote (`git push`)  
- Merging and resolving history  
- Using forks to contribute to shared/public repositories  
- Navigating project state with `git status`  
- Syncing and maintaining GitHub projects cleanly

## 📌 Milestone Highlights  

- ✅ Practiced full Git CLI cycle: staging → committing → pushing  
- ✅ Rehearsed team workflows using forking, branching, and merging  
- ✅ Explored sync flows between local work and GitHub hosting  
- ✅ Identified best practices for organizing repos during active development

## 💬 Reflection  
This module helped me internalize how real developers use Git in day-to-day projects—not through buttons, but through **precision CLI workflows** that offer speed, clarity, and flexibility. It solidified how teams commit, merge, and track changes in parallel without conflicts.

I’m actively applying these practices in my simulation and XR projects by:

- Keeping branch structures clean and readable  
- Writing focused, meaningful commit messages  
- Using forks and remotes to isolate collaboration safely  
- Maintaining a clear commit history to tell a project’s development story  

With both Modules 1 and 2 complete, I now have the foundational Git fluency to confidently manage version control in multi-developer environments.
