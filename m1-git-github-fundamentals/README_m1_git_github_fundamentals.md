# 🧱 M1 – Git & GitHub Fundamentals  
**Folder**: `m1-git-github-fundamentals`  
**Focus**: Core Git concepts, version control workflows, and GitHub collaboration basics  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced the foundational concepts of **version control** using Git and GitHub. I practiced how developers track changes, manage branching structures, and collaborate through remote repositories. These concepts were reinforced through a mix of practice files and documentation-style exercises designed to simulate real-world GitHub usage.

## 💬 Reflection  
Though introductory, this module was a valuable **refresher** that brought structure and clarity to Git habits I was already using casually in personal projects. It helped me refine:

- Clean, readable commit messaging  
- Logical branch naming and workflows  
- Clear history management for team collaboration  
- Repository organization as a professional habit  

This foundation set the tone for more advanced Git operations in later modules and aligned with my commitment to building **portfolio-quality repos** for real-world projects.
